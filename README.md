# Numerical Solver for the Modified Poisson-Boltzman Equation

A powerful solver based on succesive over-relaxation for the modified Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equation, which includes a dielectric response profile, unequal ionic valencies, surface interactions via potentials of mean force and the presence of impurities. The modified PBE is solved in the form of:
